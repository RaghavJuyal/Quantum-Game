	{"5":"The sphere has three axes: X, Y, and Z. \nThese are NOT related to the 2D directions in the game world."},
	{"6":"Next to the sphere are angles to help you control your state more precisely. Theta is the angle from the Z axis and phi is the angle from the X axis."},

The 'amplitude' of each state is given after the state for example: To represent |01>, |0> in top qubit and |1> in bottom qubit, it would show |00>: 0.0 |01>: 1.0 |10>: 0.0 |11>: 0.0."},

	{"11":"After picking up the gate, you need to add it to the circuit. The green blocks with 'Add' written above them will insert the gates to the puzzle."},
	{"12":"The bottom ones add to the bottom wire and the top ones add to the top wire. The Add blocks on the left of the wire will always insert the gate to the beginning of the circuit, and the Add blocks on the right will add it to the end of the circuit."},
	{"13":"Similarly, the 'Del' blocks in red, remove gates from either the left or right of the respective wire."},

	{"13":"IMPORTANT: Check your superposition state BEFORE you do a CNOT! \nIf you're only in state 0 when you do this, you can only create 00 and 10 states. You'll never be able to reach 01 or 11 without measuring first and starting over."},

	{"1":"Here's what makes entanglement special: the two qubits are no longer separable. You can't describe your state and the gem's state independently anymore—they're fundamentally linked."},
	{"2":"Specifically, being separable means being able to write the two-qubit state as |x>|y>, where |x> is the state of the first qubit and |y> is the state of the second qubit."},
	{"3":"For example if we had a 50% probability of being in |00> and 50% for |01>, the first qubit is always in |0> and the other qubit will have the probabilities of 50% being in |0> and 50% in |1>."},
	{"4":"But for the state you had, which was 50% probability of |00> and 50% of |11>, you can never separate the probabilities of the qubits as done above. \nThe qubits are no longer independent."},
	{"5":"If we measured and you collapsed to layer 0, the gem is guaranteed to also be on layer 0. If you're on layer 1, so is the gem. \nThey're perfectly correlated!"},
	{"6":"This correlation isn't because one qubit 'tells' the other what to do when measured, the connection already exists in the quantum state before any measurement happens—it's woven into the fabric of the state itself. \nThe measurement outcomes are connected in a way that has no classical explanation."},
	{"7":"Here's a secret: you've actually been using entangled states throughout this entire level! \nYou have created quantum correlations!"},
	{"8":"Whenever you had non-zero probabilities for both 00 and 11 basis states and zero probabilities for 01 and 10, you were working with correlated entangled states like the one you just created."},
	{"9":"Similarly, when you aimed for 01 and 10 states, you were also creating entangled states—just anti-correlated ones instead!"},
	{"10":"Not all two-qubit states are entangled. If you had been purely in state 0 and used CNOT on a gem in state 0, you'd get just |00> with 100% — that's separable as 100% first qubit being in |0> and 100% for the second being in |0> : not entangled."},
	{"11":"But the moment you create states where the probabilities can't be explained by treating each qubit independently, you've got entanglement. And you've been mastering it all along!"},
