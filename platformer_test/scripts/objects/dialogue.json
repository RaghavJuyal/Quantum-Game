		{"4":"Next to the probabilities is a sphere called the Bloch Sphere. It is a representation of your current state. Rotations on this sphere's surface allows you to change your state."},

		{"6":"You can rotate about the X, Y or Z axis by pressing the 'X', 'Y' or 'Z' keys respectively. Pressing these will change your state."},
		{"7":"Interacting with objects like collecting coins, standing on checkpoints, getting hit by enemies, etc, will 'measure' you along the Z axis."},
		{"8":"This means that you will collapse to either state 0 or state 1 with the probability shown on the left of the Bloch sphere."},

	{"4":"In quantum terms, we call this an entangled state. \nYour superposition becomes the first qubit, and the gem becomes the second."},
	{"5":"The 'C' does a CNOT gate (yes, the one you have used in the puzzles) which connects you two — if you’re on the upper layer (state 1), the gem flips layers too!"},
	{"6":"Your HUD will then appear different — instead of just probabilities for 0 and 1, you’ll see the probabilities for the four possible combinations: 00, 01, 10, and 11."},

	{"10":"After carrying the gem (post-measurement), you need to approach the yellow blocks and press 'G', which will remove some blocking obstacles that are present on both layers."},
